# Appli
Phantom's extension to A Power Library (the name stands for A Phantom Power Library, original I know).


This is an addon mod to Apoli, a mod adding a data-driven power system.

Appli is mostly a random assortment of powers, actions, or conditions I felt like making. With that said, I hope you can find a use for at least one of them.

Before using this, it's recommended you familarize yourself with the [Origins/Apoli wiki](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and how to create a datapack for it.


If you have questions/comments/concerns/suggestions/anything else, feel free to DM me on discord at `ThePhantomPig791#0003`.
